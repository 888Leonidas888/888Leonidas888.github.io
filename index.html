    <h2>What is gcc?</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.rapidtables.org/code/linux/gcc.html">GCC</a> is a
      collection of compilers created by the GNU project. A compiler is a
      program that converts the source code written in a programming language
      into machine code that can be executed by the computer. GCC supports
      several programming languages, such as C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada
      and Java. GCC is free software and is distributed under the GPL license.
      GCC is one of the most widely used compilers in software development, as
      it allows creating optimized and portable programs that work on different
      platforms .

    <h2>what happens inside?</h2>
    <p>
      When you compile a program in C using the GNU compiler
      <a href="https://www.rapidtables.org/code/linux/gcc.html">(GCC)</a>, you
      are performing a process that transforms the source code into executable
      code by the processor. This process consists of several phases, which are
      as follows
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Preprocessor</dt>
          <dd>
            Expands the source code, replacing directives such as <span>#include</span> or
            <span>#define</span> with their corresponding content.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Compiler</dt>
          <dd>
            converts the expanded code into assembly code, which is a symbolic
            representation of the low-level instructions that the processor
            understands.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Assembler</dt>
          <dd>
            converts the assembly code into object code, which is a binary form
            of the assembly code.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Linker</dt>
          <dd>
            links the object code with the necessary libraries to create the
            executable file, which contains the machine code that can be
            executed directly by the processor.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>nothing complicated</h2>
    <ol class="compiler">
      <li>Create file main.c</li>
      <p>Our program will show the famous "Hello world".</p>
      <img src="./img/hello_world.png" alt="file main.c" />
      <li>Compilation using <span>gcc main.c</span></li>
      <p>
        When using only <code>gcc main.c</code> , it will return an executable with the
        following default name <code>o.out</code> this is in Linux if you do it in windows it
        will be <code>o.exe</code>, we can change it using the following command <code>gcc -o main</code> 
        main.c, visit the
        <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html">man</a> to
        know what else he can do.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/gcc_main_c.png" alt="compilation" />
      <li>Executing our program</li>
      <p>It will be simple as using <code>./a.out</code></p>
